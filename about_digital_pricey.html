 <h1>About Digital Pricey ðŸ¤‘</h1>

<body>
 <p>I am Oderinde Praise Ayomide 
    by name. But you can call me 
    Digital Pricey or Coach Praise. I am a 100 level student in the Computer Science (pure) department under the College Of Science and Information Technology (COSIT) of Tai Solarin University of Education (TASUED for short) that was just recently made a federal University. <br>
    I dabble in many trades and
     aim everday to add new skills
     to my repertoire. But the most
     prominent among them are 
     currently Affiliate Marketing,
     Coding/Web-development, and 
     Content Creation. I started 
     my career life shortly after 
     i gained admission into the 
     University 
     (TASUED specifically), 
     and am already glad i did so.
     When i first got to school, 
     i knew that there would be 
     hectic demands that will 
     accompany my new school life
     so i started a side hustle 
     as soon as i could. As i was 
     looking for what to start, i
     came across Affiliate 
     Marketing and i knew 
     immediately that it was the
     perfect option for a side 
     hustle. This was because i 
     could make money with it and
     it wouldn't clash with my 
     academics. That has proven 
     to be true because i am 
     currently in the second 
     semester of my 100 level as 
     a first class student. The 
     best part is that not only 
     do i not need to ask for 
     money from my parents, but 
     i can also help them out 
     anytime my two younger 
     siblings need any cash. 
     In a nutshellðŸ¥œ, affiliate
     marketing has turned my life
     around for the better. You 
     too can become an affiliate 
     marketer. Yes you ðŸ«µ. Whether
     you're a secondary school 
     student, a parent who works 
     a 9-5 jod, or even a retired 
     citizen. You can be an 
     affiliate marketer. Just go back 
     to the homepage, go through the 
     orientation, and follow the 
     steps that have been given. 
     if after that you still need
     more information on this new 
     opportunity because you don't 
     want to rush in too quickly, 
     i understand and i host 
     orientation classes on my 
     online Whatsapp group
