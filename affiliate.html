  <p>  Welcome to the Digital Pricey website.<br> 
    I can't wait to introduce you 
    to what you came here for, 
    which is the introduction to 
    affiliate marketing. 
    But firstly, if you are 
    interested to know who it is 
    that is passing this message 
    across to you, click the 
    button below 👇</p>

      <h1>The Orientation 📊</h1>
      <p>Now, since you already 
        know about me, let's get 
        into what you came here 
        for.<br>
      I of course am going to 
        introduce you to a side
        hustle that can change 
        your financial 💸 life
        for the better. It is a 
        business that doesn't 
        require you to rent out 
        a shop or space online, 
        but it also isn't one of 
        those schemes where you
        put in money to get it 
        doubled which doesn't 
        even make sense though
        many fall for such schemes.
        it requires no  referrals,
        no resumes or work 
        experience, and you can 
        make money with this 
        business using just your
        phone, internet connection, 
        and 2-3 hours a day. 
        Payments are sent weekly 
        in dollars, and you can
        cashout in your local 
        currency to your local 
        bank account. It is hassle 
        free, and poses no risk to 
        start. Whether you are a 
        student of either secondary 
        school or university, 
        a parent working 9-5, or 
        even retired, this business 
        can help you as there are no
        age limitations. </p>
      
      <h2>The Business 👔</h2>
      <p>The business i have 
        talking about is known as Affiliate marketing. The business entails you using promoting online digital products such as e-books, online courses, and so much more. The digital products range over 69 different classes including online courses, digital reading books, audio books, video courses, etc. It is a business that only requires you to promote these products, have people buy them from you, and receive commission for doing so. Seems easy right? Of course it is if you can put your time into it </p>
      
      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p>To start the business, you will need Three3️⃣ things</p>
 <h3>1. An Android/IOS smartphone</h3>
 <p>If you wish to start affiliate marketing, you will need a smartphone either Android, IOS, or any device that has a means for you to pass a message across to a large audience. This puts you at an advantage if you are already a content creator, and have a good liking, following, or viewing on any social media platform including Facebook, Instagram, tiktok, or even all of them you to have them all on your device. It is important that as you are an affiliate marketer, you need to be able to generate leads on a daily basis.<br>
 NOTE: The term "Leads" is a technical term used by affiliate marketers. It simply means new clients.</p>
 
 <h3>2. Stable everyday internet connection🛜</h3>
 <p>If you need to advertise to "online" clients, and also provide them a means for them to communicate with you "online", then definitely you can't do without internet connection. As long as you have enough Internet connection everyday to promote products, and receive messages from new clients, you are good to go 👍</p>
 
 <h3>A working Bank account</h3>
 <p>If you have made sales for the week, you will need a bank account to withdraw put the money into once you've cashed out. Otherwise you'll be left with just the money you worked for, without a way to access it. Diamonds 💎 with no one to mine ⛏️ them.</p>
 
 <h3>An Affiliate account</h3>
 <p>This is the most important requirement because you need an affiliate account to be an official affiliate marketer. This is because the account is that online space where you can explore the available digital products to promote. It is also where you will make the sales of those promoted products, and receive the weekly payment for those products you've sold. Wondering where or even how you can get an affiliate account? I have the perfect one for you. Just send me a direct message on Whatsapp with the Whatsapp link in the footer of the website. You can also join the "Success minded" 😎 whatsapp group with the link also in the website's footer.</p>
 
 <p>I hope with all that you have been informed with, you will be able to take action to it. Because as they say, "Information is Power ⚡" but it is only power for those that can take action 🎬</p>
